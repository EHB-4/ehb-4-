# EHB SQL Level System ‚Äî World's Most Advanced AI & Blockchain-Based Trust Model

## Overview

EHB SQL (Service Quality Level) system is the world's most advanced AI-based, blockchain-powered, trust-driven model designed for global scalability and legal compliance across all services, users, products, and franchises.

## üß† 1. AI-Based Real-Time Trust Score Engine (RTSE)

### Core Functionality

- **Live AI Trust Score**: Calculated for every user/service using:
  - Behavior analysis (login patterns, complaint ratios)
  - Activity & transaction logs (wallet usage, job applications)
  - Feedback from other verified users (review credibility check)
  - Voice/video biometric re-verification logs

### Score Management

- **Auto-update**: Every 24 hours with explainable AI decisions
- **Trust Score Range**: 0 - 100
- **Real-time Enforcement**: Required thresholds for each SQL level enforced in real-time

## üîê 2. Multi-Layer Verification Engine (PSS + EDR + EMO)

### Layer 1: PSS (Privacy & Security System)

- **Purpose**: Identity & fraud protection
- **AI Checkpoints**:
  - ID verification
  - Document scan validation
  - Geolocation verification
  - Facial recognition

### Layer 2: EDR (Education & Development Records)

- **Purpose**: Practical knowledge proof
- **AI Checkpoints**:
  - Live skill test (voice, coding, MCQ, project)
  - Performance assessment
  - Knowledge validation

### Layer 3: EMO (Emotional & Mental Operations)

- **Purpose**: Real-world legality & compliance
- **AI Checkpoints**:
  - Legal document validation
  - Franchise verification
  - Business document AI validation

### Zero Tolerance AI Filters

- Fake uploads detection
- Duplicate KYC prevention
- Abnormal biometric data flagging

## üîÑ 3. 6-Monthly Auto SQL Review Cycle

### Review Process

Every 6 months, users undergo:

- **AI-based behavior audit**
- **Skill re-test (EDR)**
- **Live document recheck (PSS/EMO)**

### Failure Triggers

- **Auto-downgrade** to lower SQL level
- **Locked features** access restriction
- **AI training suggestions** for recovery

## üîÑ 4. Blockchain-Backed Audit Trail (Parachain System)

### Event Logging

Every verification, test, update, or reward event is:

- **Logged in parachain smart contract** (via Mosaic or Polkadot)
- **Immutable and decentralized**
- **Audit-friendly** for:
  - Local regulators
  - Corporate franchise
  - Central EHB Core Node

### Data Sovereignty Rules

- **Country-wise segregation**
- **Only country-allowed data reaches company**

## ü™ô 5. Coin-Integrated SQL Boost & Penalty System

### SQL Level Requirements

| SQL Level | Coin Lock Requirement | Benefits                         | Penalties                        |
| --------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Normal    | None                  | Standard access                  | Limited earning                  |
| High      | 500 EHBGC (locked)    | +1% Loyalty, lower fees          | 50% income loss if balance drops |
| VIP       | 1000+ EHBGC (locked)  | +1.5% Loyalty + validator unlock | 70% income held                  |

### Lock System

- **Lock duration**: 1 / 2 / 3 years (bonus-based)
- **Locking smart contract**: Auto badge verification
- **Franchise and validators**: Mandatory lock

## üß© 6. SQL-Driven Modular Access System

### Access Control Logic

Every dashboard, API, and feature block is linked with SQL logic:

- `if SQL = VIP ‚Üí Enable Validator Tools`
- `if SQL < Normal ‚Üí Disable Seller Tools`
- `if SQL = Expired ‚Üí Redirect to Re-verification Module`

## üß¨ 7. AI-Generated SQL Journey Map (Visual for Users)

### User Interface

Every user receives a visual roadmap showing:

- **Current SQL level**
- **Required next steps**
- **Real-time eligibility score**
- **"Unlock Next SQL Level" button**

### Example Display

```
üéñÔ∏è You are at: Normal (SQL 3)
üü¢ Progress: 78%
üß™ Required: EDR Test + Coin Lock
üìà Projected Unlock: SQL High by July 15
```

## üì£ 8. Gamified Rewards & Badges System

### Badge System

- **On-chain NFTs**: Badges are ERC-721 tokens
- **Auto-display**: Shown on user profiles
- **Search ranking**: Used in AI matching algorithms

### SQL Upgrade Benefits

- **Exclusive access**: Jobs/products/projects
- **AI tools**: Advanced features unlocked
- **Affiliate boosters**: Enhanced commission rates

## üéØ 9. SQL Impact Across Entire EHB Ecosystem

### Service-Specific Effects

| Module    | Effect of SQL                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| GoSellr   | Search rank, selling rights, earning %        |
| JPS       | Job access, employer trust, auto shortlisting |
| HPS       | Student/teacher visibility, income multiplier |
| WMS       | Verified doctor/hospital visibility           |
