# GoSellr Blockchain Integration Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the blockchain integration strategy for GoSellr, a global AI-powered SaaS marketplace ecosystem. The roadmap follows a phased approach with multiple chain support for maximum flexibility and scalability.

## Core Chain Selection

### Type

- **Primary**: Parachain (Polkadot) + EVM-Compatible Chain (Moonbeam) + Mosaic Galaxy Chain (DPoS)
- **Architecture**: Multi-chain ecosystem with cross-chain interoperability

### Preferred Chains

1. **Moonbeam** (for launch) - Full EVM compatibility + Substrate integration
2. **Mosaic Galaxy** (for validator income) - DPoS consensus with token reward system
3. **EHB Native Chain** (Phase 3) - Sovereign control & localized data governance

### Rationale

- **Moonbeam**: Provides full EVM compatibility + Substrate integration
- **Mosaic**: Enables validator economy + token reward system
- **EHB Native Chain**: Ensures sovereign control & localized data governance

## Token Standards

### Transaction Token

- **EHBGC** (ERC-20 + BEP-20 dual-chain support)
- Cross-chain bridge support for seamless transfers

### Utility/Reward Token

- **EHB Points** (off-chain until Phase 2, then roll to sidechain)
- Loyalty and reward system integration

### Ownership Token

- **Franchise NFT** (ERC-721 standard, upgradeable to ERC-1155 for multi-zone ownership)
- Resale with 10% royalty back to company

### Order NFT (Optional)

- NFT receipts for bulk orders over $1000
- Stored on-chain with hash-only off-chain data

## Smart Contract Modules

### 1. Escrow Wallet

```solidity
// Auto-split funds to multiple parties
- Seller: 20%
- Sub: 30%
- Master: 20%
- Corporate: 10%
- Company: 20%
```

### 2. Franchise Ownership Registry

- NFT-based ownership system
- Resale with 10% royalty back to company
- Upgradeable to ERC-1155 for multi-zone ownership

### 3. Auto-Fine Engine

- Based on complaint escalation triggers
- Auto-deduct from franchise wallet using smart contract
- Configurable fine amounts based on SQL level

### 4. SQL Upgrade Payment

- On-chain SQL tier upgrade system
- Fees locked as EHBGC with time-based unlock
- Progressive upgrade path with validation

### 5. Loyalty Rewards

- Monthly locked EHBGC earns 0.5%â€“1.1% loyalty rewards
- Handled by validator-based staking pool
- Compound interest calculation

## On-Chain Events (Publicly Stored)

### Transaction Events

- Franchise NFT purchase + ownership transfer
- Complaint fine deductions
- SQL upgrade payments + level logs
- Order completions > $500
- Referral reward logs
- Validator reward logs

### Audit Trail

- All financial transactions
- Ownership changes
- System upgrades
- Governance decisions

## Private Data (Off-chain, Hashed On-chain)

### KYC & Compliance

- KYC documents hash stored via PSS
- Complaint audio hash
- Order delivery coordinates hashed
- Wallet balance snapshots hashed (for audit)
- Test/Exam scores (EDR) verification hashes

### Data Privacy

- Personal information remains off-chain
- Only cryptographic proofs on-chain
- GDPR compliant data handling

## Node/Validator Setup Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Validator setup on Mosaic Galaxy testnet
- Reward simulation and testing
- Community building and education

### Phase 2: Mainnet Launch

- EHB Parachain launch on Polkadot
- Custom Substrate-based L1 integration
- PSS, EMO, EDR integration

### Phase 3: Governance

- DAO-based franchise-level governance
- On-chain voting system via wallet/NFT stake
- Decentralized decision making

## Developer Tools

### Smart Contract Languages

- **Solidity** (EVM) - Primary development
- **ink!** (Substrate) - Parachain development
- **Rust** (for advanced L1 use) - Performance critical components

### Development Environment

- **Remix** (initial development)
- **Hardhat + Foundry** (testing and deployment)
- **Substrate Playground** (chain simulation)

### Integration SDKs

- **Web3.js** - Ethereum/EVM integration
- **Ethers.js** - Advanced Ethereum features
- **Polkadot.js** - Substrate/Polkadot integration
- **Wagmi + RainbowKit** - Wallet integration

## Wallets Supported

### Multi-Chain Support

- **MetaMask** (Ethereum/EVM)
- **Trust Wallet** (BSC/Polygon)
- **Polkadot.js** (Mosaic, Polkadot, Parachain)
- **EHB Trusty Wallet** (Phase 2 launch, tied to SQL + auto-fine + validator stake)

### Features

- Cross-chain transaction support
- SQL level integration
- Auto-fine management
- Validator staking interface

## Explorer Integration

### Public Explorers

- **BlockScout** (for Moonbeam & EVM transactions)
- **Subscan or Polkadot Explorer** (for Parachain)
- **Custom Explorer** (planned with role-based views)

### Role-Based Views

- **Buyer**: Order history, payment tracking
- **Seller**: Sales analytics, commission tracking
- **Franchise**: Territory management, revenue sharing
- **Validator**: Staking rewards, governance participation

## Audit Plan

### Audit Firms

- **Hacken** (for marketplace contracts)
- **QuillAudits** (for validator rewards & token lock)

### Audit Phases

1. **Before franchise NFT minting goes live**
2. **Before SQL-level upgrade & reward system launch**
3. **Before validator + DAO functionality activated**

### Security Measures

- Multi-signature wallets for treasury
- Time-locked upgrades
- Emergency pause functionality
- Regular security audits

## Implementation Timeline

### Q1 2024: Foundation

- Smart contract development
- Testnet deployment
- Security audits

### Q2 2024: Launch
