## 🤖 EHB AI Agent System for SOT

### 🎯 Core Objective

Automate the full lifecycle of developer registration, task management, SQL-level control, and fraud/security analysis **without manual intervention**, using intelligent agents.

### 🧠 AI Agent Roles inside SOT

| Agent Name        | Role Description                                                                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OnboardAgent`    | Handles developer registration, PSS KYC, and EDR testing workflow                       |
| `TaskAssignBot`   | Matches tasks to developers based on skillset, history, and availability                |
| `CodeCheckAgent`  | Reviews submitted tasks for plagiarism, AI-generated code, and skill rating             |
| `SQLAuditAgent`   | Calculates performance-based SQL upgrades or downgrades                                 |
| `ComplaintAgent`  | Processes voice/video/text complaints, auto-categorizes, and routes to proper franchise |

| `WalletLockAgent` | Locks/unlocks wallet balance based on SQL requirements, fines, and franchise rules      |

### 📈 AI-Based Automation Workflows

#### 🟢 Developer Onboarding

- AI checks KYC via PSS (face + ID match)
- Auto-verifies documents or flags for manual check
- Assigns Free SQL Level by default
- AI schedules EDR test (MCQ, project, code)
- EDR result → SQL badge auto-issued

#### 🟡 Task Lifecycle (Auto Flow)

1. `TaskAssignBot` → Assigns task with deadline & estimated reward
2. Developer submits → `CodeCheckAgent` runs analysis:
   - Code quality
   - Efficiency
   - Time used vs. allowed
   - AI-detection (e.g., GPT-generated warning)
3. Score sent to `SQLAuditAgent`:
   - SQL Score ↑ if passed well
   - SQL Score ↓ if failed or delayed
4. `RewardAgent` pays based on score + locked wallet ratio

#### 🧠 Complaint Handling (Voice, Video, Text)

- User records issue (voice/video/text)
- `ComplaintAgent` runs AI transcription (whisper, NLP)
- Detects:
  - Topic (task, payment, fraud, delay)
  - Sentiment (angry, neutral, frustrated)
  - Urgency (auto-priority flag)
- Routes to correct franchise level
- `SQLAuditAgent` marks dispute record in profile

### 🏆 SQL Level AI Score Breakdown

Each user has a **Trust Index**, **Performance Index**, and **Complaint Index**. AI calculates score on:

| Metric                 | Weight |
| ---------------------- | ------ |
| Task Completion Rate   | 30%    |
| AI Skill Check Score   | 20%    |
| Complaint Flags        | -20%   |
| Peer Review / Feedback | 10%    |
| Wallet Lock (EHBGC)    | 10%    |
| Login Activity         | 10%    |

SQL upgrade thresholds:

- Free → Basic: 50+
- Basic → Normal: 70+
- Normal → High: 85+
- High → VIP: 95+
