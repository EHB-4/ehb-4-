# EHB Auto-Push System Guide

## Overview

The EHB Auto-Push System automatically monitors your project files and pushes changes to GitHub in real-time. This ensures your code is always backed up and synchronized with your remote repository.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Real-time file watching
- ‚úÖ Intelligent commit messages
- ‚úÖ Automatic conflict resolution
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring
- ‚úÖ Multiple startup methods
- ‚úÖ Error handling and recovery

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Using npm scripts (Recommended)

```bash
# Start auto-push system
npm run auto-push:start

# Or use the enhanced version
npm run auto-push:watch
```

### Method 2: Using batch file (Windows)

```bash
# Double-click or run from command line
start-auto-push.bat
```

### Method 3: Using PowerShell (Windows)

```powershell
# Run PowerShell script
npm run auto-push:ps

# Or directly
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File start-auto-push.ps1
```

### Method 4: Direct Node.js execution

```bash
# Run the auto-push script directly
node scripts/ehb-auto-push.js
```

## Prerequisites

### 1. Node.js Installation

Make sure Node.js is installed on your system:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

### 2. Git Repository Setup

Ensure your project is a git repository with a remote origin:

```bash
# Check if git is initialized
git status

# If not initialized, run:
git init

# Add remote origin (replace with your GitHub repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ehb-next-js-04.git
```

### 3. Dependencies Installation

The system will automatically install required dependencies, but you can also install them manually:

```bash
npm run auto-push:install
```

## Configuration

### Auto-Push Script Configuration

The main auto-push script (`scripts/ehb-auto-push.js`) can be configured by modifying these options:

```javascript
const options = {
  watchPath: '.', // Directory to watch
  pushInterval: 30000, // Push interval in milliseconds (30 seconds)
  commitMessage: 'EHB Auto-Push', // Default commit message
  branch: 'main', // Target branch
  excludePatterns: [
    // Files to ignore
    'node_modules/**',
    '.git/**',
    '.next/**',
    '*.log',
    // ... more patterns
  ],
};
```

### File Priority System

The system categorizes files by priority:

**Critical Files** (immediate push):

- `package.json`
- `next.config.js`
- `tailwind.config.js`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `app/**/*.tsx`
- `components/**/*.tsx`
- `lib/**/*.ts`

**High Priority Files** (quick push):

- `docs/**/*`
- `scripts/**/*`
- `*.md`
- `*.css`

**Normal Files** (batch push):

- All other files

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start the auto-push system
npm run auto-push:start
```

### With Custom Configuration

```bash
# Start with custom options
node scripts/ehb-auto-push.js --watchPath ./app --pushInterval 60000
```

### Monitoring Mode

```bash
# Start with enhanced monitoring
npm run auto-push:watch
```

## What the System Does

### 1. File Watching

- Monitors all project files for changes
- Ignores temporary files and build artifacts
- Categorizes changes by priority

### 2. Automatic Committing

- Stages all changes automatically
- Creates intelligent commit messages with timestamps
- Includes file information in commit messages

### 3. Automatic Pushing

- Pushes changes to GitHub every 30 seconds
- Handles conflicts automatically
- Provides real-time feedback

### 4. Performance Monitoring

- Tracks push/pull performance
- Monitors memory usage
- Logs error statistics

## Monitoring and Logs

### Real-time Status

The system provides real-time status updates:

```
üöÄ Starting EHB Auto-Push System...
‚úÖ All checks passed!
üëÄ File watcher initialized
üìù change: app/page.tsx (app, critical)
üîÑ Starting push (critical)...
üì¶ Changes staged
üíæ Changes committed
üöÄ Changes pushed to remote
‚úÖ Push completed successfully!
```

### Performance Statistics

Every minute, the system logs performance statistics:

```
üìä ===== EHB AUTO-PUSH PERFORMANCE STATS =====
‚è±Ô∏è  Uptime: 5m 30s
üîÑ Total pushes: 12
‚¨áÔ∏è  Total pulls: 3
üìù Total files processed: 45
‚ö° Average push time: 2.3s
üíæ Memory usage: 45.2MB
‚ùå Errors: 0
üåø Current branch: main
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Not a git repository" Error

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ehb-next-js-04.git
```

#### 2. "No remote origin found" Error

```bash
# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ehb-next-js-04.git

# Verify remote
git remote -v
```

#### 3. "chokidar not found" Error

```bash
# Install chokidar dependency
npm install chokidar

# Or use the auto-install script
npm run auto-push:install
```

#### 4. Push Conflicts

The system automatically handles conflicts by:

- Pulling latest changes before pushing
- Using `--no-verify` flag to skip hooks
- Providing detailed error messages

### Error Recovery

If the system encounters errors:

1. Check the console output for specific error messages
2. Verify your git configuration
3. Ensure you have proper permissions
4. Restart the system if needed

## Advanced Features

### Custom File Patterns

You can customize which files are watched by modifying the `excludePatterns` in the script:

```javascript
excludePatterns: [
  'node_modules/**',
  '.git/**',
  '.next/**',
  'dist/**',
  'build/**',
  '*.log',
  'temp-backup/**',
  'logs/**',
  'cypress/videos/**',
  'cypress/screenshots/**',
  'playwright-report/**',
  'test-results/**',
  '.env.local',
  '.env.production',
];
```

### Multiple Branch Support

To work with different branches:

```bash
# Switch to a different branch
git checkout feature-branch

# Start auto-push for that branch
node scripts/ehb-auto-push.js --branch feature-branch
```

### Integration with Development Workflow

The auto-push system works seamlessly with your development workflow:

1. **During Development**: Files are automatically committed and pushed
2. **Before Commits**: System pulls latest changes to avoid conflicts
3. **After Builds**: Build artifacts are ignored automatically
4. **Error Handling**: System continues working even if some pushes fail

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Monitoring

- Check the console output regularly
- Monitor performance statistics
- Address any errors promptly

### 2. Backup Strategy

- The system creates automatic backups in `temp-backup/`
- Keep your GitHub repository as the primary backup
- Consider additional backup solutions for critical data

### 3. Performance Optimization

- The system is optimized for performance
- Monitor memory usage if running for extended periods
- Restart the system if performance degrades

### 4. Security Considerations

- Ensure sensitive files are in `.gitignore`
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Regularly review what's being committed

## Stopping the System

### Graceful Shutdown

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the system gracefully. The system will:

- Close file watchers
- Complete any pending operations
- Display final statistics
- Exit cleanly

### Force Stop

If the system becomes unresponsive:

```bash
# Kill all Node.js processes (Windows)
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Kill all Node.js processes (Linux/Mac)
pkill -f node
```

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance

- Update dependencies regularly: `npm update`
- Check for script updates
- Monitor system performance
- Review and clean up backup files

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check this guide first
2. Review the console output for error messages
3. Verify your git and Node.js setup
4. Check the GitHub repository for updates
