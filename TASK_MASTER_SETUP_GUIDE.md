scripts/
└── prd.txt             # Product Requirements Document
```

## 🚀 Getting Started with Task Master

### 1. Enable Task Master in Cursor

1. Open Cursor Settings (Ctrl+Shift+J)
2. Click on the MCP tab on the left
3. Enable `task-master-ai` with the toggle

### 2. Configure API Keys (Optional)

Edit `.cursor/mcp.json` and add your API keys:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "taskmaster-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package=task-master-ai", "task-master-ai"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your_anthropic_key",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_key",
        "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "your_google_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Initialize Task Master for EHB Project

In Cursor's AI chat, say:

```
Initialize taskmaster-ai in my project
```

### 4. Parse the EHB PRD

In Cursor's AI chat, say:

```
Can you parse my PRD at scripts/prd.txt?
```

## 📋 Common Task Master Commands

### Via Cursor AI Chat:

- **Parse PRD**: `Can you parse my PRD at scripts/prd.txt?`
- **View Tasks**: `Can you show me all tasks?`
- **Next Task**: `What's the next task I should work on?`
- **Implement Task**: `Can you help me implement task 3?`
- **Research**: `Research the latest best practices for Next.js 14 App Router`
- **Expand Task**: `Can you help me expand task 4?`

### Via Command Line:

```bash
# List all tasks
task-master list

# Show next task
task-master next

# Show specific tasks
task-master show 1,3,5

# Research information
task-master research "Next.js 14 best practices"

# Generate task files
task-master generate
```
