# EHB Continuous Agent - Never Stops

## Overview

The EHB Continuous Agent is a robust, always-running agent that ensures your development environment is continuously monitored and maintained. Unlike traditional agents that complete tasks and exit, this agent runs 24/7 and never stops working.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”„ Never Stops
- **Continuous Operation**: The agent runs indefinitely and never exits
- **Auto-Restart**: Automatically restarts if it encounters any issues
- **Error Recovery**: Handles uncaught exceptions and continues running
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Only stops when explicitly requested (Ctrl+C)

### ðŸ“Š Real-Time Monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Every 2 minutes
- **Service Monitoring**: Every 5 minutes
- **Status Updates**: Every 10 minutes
- **Auto-Fix**: Automatically restarts failed services

### ðŸ¤– Intelligent Management
- **Service Detection**: Monitors all EHB services (Frontend, Backend, Admin Panel, Portal)
- **Port Management**: Checks if services are running on correct ports
- **Auto-Restart**: Automatically restarts services that have stopped
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all activities

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Using npm scripts
```bash
# Start the continuous agent
npm run continuous

# Or use the alias
npm run agent

# Or use the monitor alias
npm run monitor
```

### Method 2: Direct execution
```bash
# Start the continuous agent directly
node scripts/ehb-continuous-agent.cjs
```

### Method 3: Using PowerShell
```powershell
# Start with PowerShell script
.\scripts\start-continuous-agent.ps1
```

### Method 4: Using batch file
```cmd
# Start with batch file
start-continuous-agent.bat
```

## Service Monitoring

The continuous agent monitors the following services:

| Service | Port | URL | Auto-Restart |
|---------|------|-----|--------------|
| Frontend | 3000 | http://localhost:3000 | âœ… |
| Backend | 5000 | http://localhost:5000 | âœ… |
| Admin Panel | 8000 | http://localhost:8000 | âœ… |
| Portal | 8080 | http://localhost:8080 | âœ… |

## Health Check Process

1. **Port Verification**: Checks if services are listening on their designated ports
2. **Connection Test**: Attempts to connect to each service
3. **Status Reporting**: Logs the health status of all services
4. **Auto-Recovery**: Automatically restarts failed services

## Logging

The agent creates comprehensive logs in the `logs/` directory:

- `health-status.json`: Current health status of all services
- `agent-errors.json`: Any errors encountered by the agent
- Console output: Real-time status updates

## Error Handling

### Uncaught Exceptions
- Logs the error with full stack trace
- Continues running despite the error
- Maintains system stability

### Service Failures
- Detects when services stop responding
- Automatically restarts failed services
- Logs all restart attempts

### Network Issues
- Handles connection timeouts gracefully
- Retries failed health checks
- Maintains operation during network problems

## Configuration

The agent can be configured by modifying the following parameters in `scripts/ehb-continuous-agent.cjs`:

```javascript
// Health check interval (2 minutes)
this.healthCheckInterval = setInterval(async () => {
  // Health check logic
}, 2 * 60 * 1000);

// Service monitoring interval (5 minutes)
this.monitoringInterval = setInterval(async () => {
  // Service monitoring logic
}, 5 * 60 * 1000);

// Status update interval (10 minutes)
this.statusInterval = setInterval(() => {
  // Status update logic
}, 10 * 60 * 1000);
```

## Integration with Master System

The continuous agent is integrated with the master startup system:

```javascript
// In ehb-master-start.js
const continuousAgent = {
  name: 'ðŸ”„ Continuous Agent',
  script: 'scripts/ehb-continuous-agent.cjs',
  autoRestart: true,
  healthCheck: true
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Won't Start
1. Check if Node.js is installed: `node --version`
2. Verify the script exists: `ls scripts/ehb-continuous-agent.cjs`
3. Check for port conflicts: `netstat -an | findstr :3000`

### Agent Stops Unexpectedly
1. Check the logs in `logs/agent-errors.json`
2. Verify system resources (memory, CPU)
3. Check for antivirus interference

### Services Not Auto-Restarting
1. Verify service configurations in the script
2. Check if service folders exist
3. Ensure proper permissions for service directories

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. Start the continuous agent at the beginning of your work session
2. Let it run in the background while you develop
3. Monitor the console output for any issues
4. Use the health status logs to track system stability

### Production Deployment
1. Use process managers like PM2 for production
2. Set up monitoring and alerting
3. Configure log rotation
4. Implement backup and recovery procedures

## Commands Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run continuous` | Start the continuous agent |
| `npm run agent` | Alias for continuous agent |
| `npm run monitor` | Alias for continuous agent |
| `npm run start-all` | Start all services with continuous agent |
| `npm run master` | Start master system with continuous agent |

## Architecture

```
EHB Continuous Agent
â”œâ”€â”€ Health Check System (2 min intervals)
â”œâ”€â”€ Service Monitor (5 min intervals)
â”œâ”€â”€ Status Reporter (10 min intervals)
â”œâ”€â”€ Auto-Recovery System
â”œâ”€â”€ Error Handler

```

## Performance

- **Memory Usage**: ~50-100MB
- **CPU Usage**: <1% (idle)
- **Network**: Minimal (health checks only)
- **Disk**: Log files only

## Security

- No external network connections
- Local-only monitoring
- No sensitive data collection
- Secure error logging

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the logs in `logs/` directory
2. Review console output for error messages
3. Verify service configurations
4. Check system resources
